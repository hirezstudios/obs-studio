OBS for Game Clients

	The purpose of these modifications to OBS are to provide an easy way for game clients to utilize OBS's rich streaming featureset while being mostly a background process, transparent to the user of the game.
	- Command line arguments have been added to start OBS with settings from the game.
	- OBS can be 'attached' to the game client. If the game client closes for any reason, OBS can shutdown.
	
	These changes have only been tested on Windows, but may work on other platforms.
